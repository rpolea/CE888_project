Project 1: Drone-based Pile Burn Image Classification for ’Fire-vs-No Fire’

To enable the Assignment 1 Jupyter notebook to run, please change the code that points to file locations to the location where you have stored the FLAME dataset images. Code has been added to the notebook to identify where this needs to be changed.

You can access the files for the FLAME dataset on the University sharepoint located below:
