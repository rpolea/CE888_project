CE888 Assignment 2
Project 1: Drone-based Pile Burn Image Classification for ’Fire-vs-No Fire’

The Assignment 2 full model pipeline makes use of Google Colaboratory to reduce the run time of the workbook. Please ensure the settings are setup to use the GPU before running any code. Both zip files are expected to be uploaded into google drive before using the workbook or code. To enable the Assignment 2 Jupyter notebook to run, please change the code that points to file locations to the location where you have stored the FLAME dataset images.

Once the directory to the images is set up correctly, the code is set up to run in one script/notebook where it will load the images, train, test and evaluate the four transfer models.

To enable the Exploratory Data Analysis Jupyter notebook to run, please change the code that points to file locations to the location where you have stored the FLAME dataset images.

You can access the files for the FLAME dataset on the University sharepoint located below: https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hr17576_essex_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fhr17576%5Fessex%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FData%2FFire%2Dvs%2DNoFire&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9lc3NleHVuaXZlcnNpdHktbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmY6L2cvcGVyc29uYWwvaHIxNzU3Nl9lc3NleF9hY191ay9FcGxRaDZyd0E4cEpoSFAwaktmZzYta0JWSHliMUJFOVRDQWo0TVZSMHR5T0VBP3J0aW1lPXVYekJtR2JaMkVn
